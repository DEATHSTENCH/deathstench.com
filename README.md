I Invoke Thee: The Bornless One.
Come Thou Forth and Follow Me
and Make All Spirits Subject unto Me 
So That Every Spirit of the Firmament, and of the Ether: 
Upon the Earth and Under the Earth: 
On Dry Land, or in the Water: 
Of Whirling Air or of Rushing Fire: 
and Every Spell and Scourge of God, 
May Be Obedient unto Me! 
Iao: Sabao: 
Such are the Words!
